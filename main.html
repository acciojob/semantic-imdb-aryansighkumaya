		<p>I had the pleasure of seeing Kill at its world premier during the Toronto International Film Festival, as part of a Midnight Madness screening. Kill represents an impressive change of pace for Indian cinema. Yes, action movies continue to be a mainstay of the genre, but rarely do Indian films feel welcome along their East and Southeast Asian compatriots. If I could best describe this film, think the sincerity and raw emotion of Indian cinema with the quality choreography of The Raid, Oldboy, or any Tony Jaa film.</p>
